To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a 
centralised system of administration throughout his 
empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered 
rulers through marriage and diplomacy. Timurid and 
Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with 
indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo-Persian 
culture emerged characterized by Mughal style arts, 
painting, and architecture. By abolishing the sectarian 
tax on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and 
military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the 
trust and loyalty of the native subjects. Eschewing tribal 
bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite 
far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed 
through an Indo-Persian culture, to himself as an emperor. 
He had Sanskrit literature translated, participated in 
native festivals, realising that a stable empire depended 
on the co-operation and good-will of his subjects. 
To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally 
diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the 
support of his non-Muslim subjects.
